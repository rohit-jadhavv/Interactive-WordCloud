# Interactive World Cloud
A word cloud (or tag cloud) is a visual representation of text data where words are arranged in different sizes, with the size representing the word's frequency or importance in the given text.

This project is an interactive word cloud generator that utilizes Flask to create a web application for visualizing the most frequently occurring words in a text corpus. The word cloud is dynamically generated based on the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) representation of the provided texts. Users can click on individual words in the word cloud, triggering an alert message that indicates in which texts that word appears.
